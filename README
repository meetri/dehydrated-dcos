Generate LetsEncrypt SSL Certificates for any domain you own.
Requires domains to be managed via Amazon's Route53

Usage:
- create IAM account with access to Amazon's Route53 API
- create boto.cfg in /etc/boto.cfg on your host using the aws key & secret
- when launching your container add the /etc/boto.cfg to your container via volume mount
- provide a list of domains to register delimited by semicolon.

Deployment Example:
docker run --name dehydrated-letsencrypt -v /etc/boto.cfg:/etc/boto.cfg \
   -v /certs:/certs \
   -e DOMAINS="mydomain.com www.mydomain.com;myotherdomain.com beta.myotherdomain.com"
   -tid meetri/dehydrated-dcos
   
My goal with this project is to have a fully automated system for signing certificates and distributing 
them where needed to services inside my cluster. 

Stay tuned for more updates
